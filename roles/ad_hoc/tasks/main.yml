## This playbook is based on this stack overflow answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/20572360
## To use, you must pass the command of interest in the "command" variable (required by the playbook)
## Note that proper string quoting is important to run `vctl status` you'd need something like:
##      ansible-playbook [...] path/to/ad-hoc.yml -e "command='vctl status'"
##      where the [...] is any normal ansible-playbook options, including inventory or limits.
